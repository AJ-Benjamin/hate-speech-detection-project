# hate-speech-detection-project
A supervised learning NLP Project for Classification of tweets into hate speech or not hate speech. I developed and experimented with over 5 models including GRU, LSTM, Conv1D, bidirectional RNN model. Used Naive Bayes of accuracy 81.66% as baseline result/model. I implemented transfer learning by using a pretrained model from TensorFlow hub giving an accuracy of 83.34%. I concluded by stacking together baseline, LSTM, TensorFlow hub pretrained models (ensemble) which boast accuracy to 87.10%.
