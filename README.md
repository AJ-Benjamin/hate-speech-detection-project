# hate-speech-detection-project
A supevised learning of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project for Classification of tweets into hate speech or not hate speech. I built and experimented with 5 models like Conv1D, bidirectional RNN model while using Naive Bayers model as baseline result/model. I concluded it by implementing transfer learning and model ensembling/stacking.
